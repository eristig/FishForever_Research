## R Markdown

Here is a complete Markdown document combining work from ER, LN and DG's combined analysis on Rare's Fish Forever survey data. 


To start, we'll read in *all* relevant CSVs

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# Read in .csv from new Rare data portal
hhs_all <- read_csv(here("new_portal_data", "hh_surveys_all.csv"))
# Read in separate question .csvs from the new Rare data portal
hhs_q44 <- read_csv(here("new_portal_data", "hh_q44.csv"))
hhs_q45 <- read_csv(here("new_portal_data", "hh_q45.csv"))
hhs_q48 <- read_csv(here("new_portal_data", "hh_q48.csv"))
```


Next, we go through questions 44, 45, and 48 to remove any duplicates

We do this because, when reading in the original CSVs, we saw answers like, "Yes, Yes, Yes," "No, No, No, No, No" and "Yes male, yes Female, Unsure."

These questions ask respondents about their *household,* so it's possible that they answered individually for each member of their hosuehold. 
However, the goal of this analysis is just to see if any single member of a hosuehold participated the management meetings, or enforcement.  



```{r}
# Check dupes for all questions
dupes_44 <- data.frame(table(hhs_q44$submissionid)) %>% 
  rename(submissionid = Var1)
dupes_45 <- data.frame(table(hhs_q45$submissionid)) %>% 
  rename(submissionid = Var1)
dupes_48 <- data.frame(table(hhs_q48$submissionid)) %>% 
  rename(submissionid = Var1)
```

The chunks below use recode() to change cells within Qs 44, 45, and 48 to each have a single answer. 

```{r}
# Cleaning data
# Question 44
hhs_q44_dupes <- hhs_q44 %>% 
  inner_join(dupes_44, hhs_q44, by = "submissionid") %>% 
  arrange(desc(submissionid)) 
# Drops rows where submissionid's with a frequency greater than 1 are labeled "Not sure"
hhs_q44_dupes <- hhs_q44_dupes[!(hhs_q44_dupes$Freq > 1 & hhs_q44_dupes$`44_meeting_attendance` == "Not sure"),]
# Drops rows that have NA
hhs_q44_dupes <- hhs_q44_dupes[!(hhs_q44_dupes$`44_meeting_attendance` == "na"),] 
# Changes "No management to "No"
hhs_q44_dupes <- hhs_q44_dupes %>%
  mutate(`44_meeting_attendance` = recode_factor(`44_meeting_attendance`, "No management" = "No"))
# Probably want to do this last
hhs_q44_dupes <- hhs_q44_dupes %>%
  group_by(submissionid, Freq) %>%
  summarise(`44_meeting_attendance` = paste(`44_meeting_attendance`, collapse = ' ')) %>% 
  select(-Freq)
# Checks to see if there are any dupes left
hhs_q44_dupes_2 <- data.frame(table(hhs_q44_dupes$submissionid)) %>% 
  rename(submissionid = Var1)
# Now recode the answer combos into Yes, No, & Not Sure only
hhs_q44_dupes <- hhs_q44_dupes %>%
  mutate(`44_meeting_attendance` = recode_factor(`44_meeting_attendance`, "Yes female" = "Yes"))
hhs_q44_dupes <- hhs_q44_dupes %>%
  mutate(`44_meeting_attendance` = recode_factor(`44_meeting_attendance`, "Yes male" = "Yes"))
hhs_q44_dupes <- hhs_q44_dupes %>%
  mutate(`44_meeting_attendance` = recode_factor(`44_meeting_attendance`, "Yes male Yes female" = "Yes"))
hhs_q44_dupes <- hhs_q44_dupes %>%
  mutate(`44_meeting_attendance` = recode_factor(`44_meeting_attendance`, "Yes female Yes male" = "Yes"))
hhs_q44_dupes <- hhs_q44_dupes %>%
  mutate(`44_meeting_attendance` = recode_factor(`44_meeting_attendance`, "Yes male No" = "Yes"))
hhs_q44_dupes <- hhs_q44_dupes %>%
  mutate(`44_meeting_attendance` = recode_factor(`44_meeting_attendance`, "No Yes male" = "Yes"))
hhs_q44_dupes <- hhs_q44_dupes %>%
  mutate(`44_meeting_attendance` = recode_factor(`44_meeting_attendance`, "Yes female Yes male No" = "Yes"))
hhs_q44_dupes <- hhs_q44_dupes %>%
  mutate(`44_meeting_attendance` = recode_factor(`44_meeting_attendance`, "No Yes female" = "Yes"))
hhs_q44_dupes <- hhs_q44_dupes %>%
  mutate(`44_meeting_attendance` = recode_factor(`44_meeting_attendance`, "Yes female No" = "Yes"))
hhs_q44_dupes <- hhs_q44_dupes %>%
  mutate(`44_meeting_attendance` = recode_factor(`44_meeting_attendance`, "Yes male No Yes female" = "Yes"))
hhs_q44_dupes <- hhs_q44_dupes %>%
  mutate(`44_meeting_attendance` = recode_factor(`44_meeting_attendance`, "No No" = "No"))
```


The following chunk combines duplicated from Question 45, and renames the observations that have been repeated. 
End result: 1 observation for each submission ID


Note: After Larissa did all the cleaning below, there was an issue witht the `recode()` function. Dylan replaced each of these with `recode_factor()` and all factor levels are fine. 
```{r}
# Question 45
hhs_q45_dupes <- hhs_q45 %>% 
  inner_join(dupes_45, hhs_q45, by = "submissionid") %>% 
  arrange(desc(submissionid)) 
# Drops rows where submissionid's with a frequency greater than 1 are labeled "Not sure"
hhs_q45_dupes <- hhs_q45_dupes[!(hhs_q45_dupes$Freq > 1 & hhs_q45_dupes$`45_leadership_position` == "Not sure"),]
# Drops rows that have NA
hhs_q45_dupes <- hhs_q45_dupes[!(hhs_q45_dupes$`45_leadership_position` == "na"),] 
# Changes "No management" option to "No"
hhs_q45_dupes <- hhs_q45_dupes %>%
  mutate(`45_leadership_position` = recode_factor(`45_leadership_position`, "No management" = "No"))
# Probably want to do this last - Freq column here is artifact
hhs_q45_dupes <- hhs_q45_dupes %>%
  group_by(submissionid, Freq) %>%
  summarise(`45_leadership_position` = paste(`45_leadership_position`, collapse = ' ')) %>% 
  select(-Freq)
# Checks to see if there are any dupes left
hhs_q45_dupes_2 <- data.frame(table(hhs_q45_dupes$submissionid)) %>% 
  rename(submissionid = Var1)
# Now recode the answer combos into Yes, No, & Not Sure only
hhs_q45_dupes <- hhs_q45_dupes %>%
  mutate(`45_leadership_position` = recode_factor(`45_leadership_position`, "Yes female" = "Yes"))
hhs_q45_dupes <- hhs_q45_dupes %>%
  mutate(`45_leadership_position` = recode_factor(`45_leadership_position`, "Yes male" = "Yes"))
hhs_q45_dupes <- hhs_q45_dupes %>%
  mutate(`45_leadership_position` = recode_factor(`45_leadership_position`, "Yes male Yes female" = "Yes"))
hhs_q45_dupes <- hhs_q45_dupes %>%
  mutate(`45_leadership_position` = recode_factor(`45_leadership_position`, "Yes female Yes male" = "Yes"))
hhs_q45_dupes <- hhs_q45_dupes %>%
  mutate(`45_leadership_position` = recode_factor(`45_leadership_position`, "Yes male No" = "Yes"))
hhs_q45_dupes <- hhs_q45_dupes %>%
  mutate(`45_leadership_position` = recode_factor(`45_leadership_position`, "No Yes male" = "Yes"))
hhs_q45_dupes <- hhs_q45_dupes %>%
  mutate(`45_leadership_position` = recode_factor(`45_leadership_position`, "No Yes female" = "Yes"))
hhs_q45_dupes <- hhs_q45_dupes %>%
  mutate(`45_leadership_position` = recode_factor(`45_leadership_position`, "Yes female No" = "Yes"))
hhs_q45_dupes <- hhs_q45_dupes %>%
  mutate(`45_leadership_position` = recode_factor(`45_leadership_position`, "Yes male Yes male" = "Yes"))
hhs_q45_dupes <- hhs_q45_dupes %>%
  mutate(`45_leadership_position` = recode_factor(`45_leadership_position`, "No No No" = "No"))
hhs_q45_dupes <- hhs_q45_dupes %>%
  mutate(`45_leadership_position` = recode_factor(`45_leadership_position`, "No No" = "No"))
```


Below, the same happens for question 48
```{r}
# Question 48 
hhs_q48_dupes <- hhs_q48 %>% 
  inner_join(dupes_48, hhs_q48, by = "submissionid") %>% 
  arrange(desc(submissionid)) 
# Drops rows where submissionid's with a frequency greater than 1 are labeled "Not sure"
hhs_q48_dupes <- hhs_q48_dupes[!(hhs_q48_dupes$Freq > 1 & hhs_q48_dupes$`48_enforcement_participation` == "Not sure"),]
# Drops rows that have NA
hhs_q48_dupes <- hhs_q48_dupes[!(hhs_q48_dupes$`48_enforcement_participation` == "na"),] 
# Changes "No management" option to "No"
hhs_q48_dupes <- hhs_q48_dupes %>%
  mutate(`48_enforcement_participation` = recode_factor(`48_enforcement_participation`, "No management" = "No"))
# Change "No enforcement system" and "There is no enforcement system" to "No"
hhs_q48_dupes <- hhs_q48_dupes %>%
  mutate(`48_enforcement_participation` = recode_factor(`48_enforcement_participation`, "No enforcement system" = "No"))
hhs_q48_dupes <- hhs_q48_dupes %>%
  mutate(`48_enforcement_participation` = recode_factor(`48_enforcement_participation`, "There is no enforcement system" = "No"))
# Probably want to do this last - Freq column here is artifact
hhs_q48_dupes <- hhs_q48_dupes %>%
  group_by(submissionid, Freq) %>%
  summarise(`48_enforcement_participation` = paste(`48_enforcement_participation`, collapse = ' ')) %>% 
  select(-Freq)
# Checks to see if there are any dupes left
hhs_q48_dupes_2 <- data.frame(table(hhs_q48_dupes$submissionid)) #%>% 
  #rename(submissionid = Var1)
# Now recode the answer combos into Yes, No, & Not Sure only
hhs_q48_dupes <- hhs_q48_dupes %>%
  mutate(`48_enforcement_participation` = recode_factor(`48_enforcement_participation`, "Yes female" = "Yes"))
hhs_q48_dupes <- hhs_q48_dupes %>%
  mutate(`48_enforcement_participation` = recode_factor(`48_enforcement_participation`, "Yes male" = "Yes"))
hhs_q48_dupes <- hhs_q48_dupes %>%
  mutate(`48_enforcement_participation` = recode_factor(`48_enforcement_participation`, "Yes male Yes female" = "Yes"))
hhs_q48_dupes <- hhs_q48_dupes %>%
  mutate(`48_enforcement_participation` = recode_factor(`48_enforcement_participation`, "Yes female Yes male" = "Yes"))
hhs_q48_dupes <- hhs_q48_dupes %>%
  mutate(`48_enforcement_participation` = recode_factor(`48_enforcement_participation`, "Yes male No" = "Yes"))
hhs_q48_dupes <- hhs_q48_dupes %>%
  mutate(`48_enforcement_participation` = recode_factor(`48_enforcement_participation`, "No Yes male" = "Yes"))
hhs_q48_dupes <- hhs_q48_dupes %>%
  mutate(`48_enforcement_participation` = recode_factor(`48_enforcement_participation`, "No Yes female" = "Yes"))
hhs_q48_dupes <- hhs_q48_dupes %>%
  mutate(`48_enforcement_participation` = recode_factor(`48_enforcement_participation`, "Yes female No" = "Yes"))
hhs_q48_dupes <- hhs_q48_dupes %>%
  mutate(`48_enforcement_participation` = recode_factor(`48_enforcement_participation`, "No No No" = "No"))
hhs_q48_dupes <- hhs_q48_dupes %>%
  mutate(`48_enforcement_participation` = recode_factor(`48_enforcement_participation`, "No No" = "No"))
hhs_q48_dupes <- hhs_q48_dupes %>%
  mutate(`48_enforcement_participation` = recode_factor(`48_enforcement_participation`, "Yes male No No" = "Yes"))
hhs_q48_dupes <- hhs_q48_dupes %>%
  mutate(`48_enforcement_participation` = recode_factor(`48_enforcement_participation`, "No No Yes male" = "Yes"))
hhs_q48_dupes <- hhs_q48_dupes %>%
  mutate(`48_enforcement_participation` = recode_factor(`48_enforcement_participation`, "Yes female Yes female Yes female" = "Yes"))
hhs_q48_dupes <- hhs_q48_dupes %>%
  mutate(`48_enforcement_participation` = recode_factor(`48_enforcement_participation`, "Yes female Yes male No" = "Yes"))
```

Again, `recode()` has been switched to `recode_factor()` for question 48

After recoding/cleaning, these different df were all combined into `hhs_complete_all` using `right_join`

```{r}
# Join the datasets after all the cleaning is done
hhs_all_48 <- right_join(hhs_q48_dupes, hhs_all, by = "submissionid")
hhs_all_45 <- right_join(hhs_q45_dupes, hhs_all_48, by = "submissionid")
hhs_all_complete <- right_join(hhs_q44_dupes, hhs_all_45, by = "submissionid")
#write.csv(hhs_all_complete, file = "hhs_all_complete.csv")
# No need to run the above code again, I have already written a .csv with the joined datasets
hhs_all_complete <- read_csv(here("new_portal_data", "hhs_all_complete.csv"))
```


Here is a quick summary table of the total number of responses, which matches the **original** number of surveys completed
17712
```{r}
# Get list of all reserves by country & how many HH surveys were answered
summary <- hhs_all_complete %>% 
  count(country, level1_name, level2_name, ma_name) %>% 
  #arrange(-n) %>% 
  mutate(level1_name = fct_reorder(country, n, sum)) %>% 
  adorn_totals("row")
# Summary table contains two NA's in the 'ma_name' column
# 75 reserves if you look at uniques
```

##### Filtering Cleaned Data

Alright! 

This marks the end of the "cleaning" data section. The final two dataframes 
(hhs_all_complete and summary) have each survey resonse as 1 row, with no duplicates, and questions that were answered multiple times (44, 45, and 48) now have 1 answer of *Yes, No,* or *Unsure*. 



##### Filtering out NAs:

*Goal: A robust df with only observations (survey respondents) who have answered every engagement and agreement question.*

This will be called **`hhs_complete_filtered`**

First, let me get counts of the NAs that we are changing to neutral for Q 44 and 45: 

```{r}
counts_44_45 <- hhs_all_complete %>% 
  data.frame() %>% 
  clean_names() %>% 
  count(x44_meeting_attendance, x45_leadership_position) 
```


```{r}
 hhs_complete_filtered <- hhs_all_complete %>% 
  data.frame() %>% 
  clean_names() %>% 
 select( c(1:2, 6:18, 21:28, x44_meeting_attendance, x45_leadership_position,
x48_enforcement_participation,  x53_encourage_regulations,
 x61g_fishing_change_behavior,
            x43_ma_benefits, x46_represent_interests,  x52_ma_benefit_5yrs, x53_encourage_regulations, x61a_current_regulations, x61f_rights_distribution_fair, x64_wrong_fishing_reserve,

x11k_months_other, x11k_other_source, 
x12a_fishing_men, x12b_fishing_women, x12c_fishing_children, 
x19_current_fish_catch, 
x22_catch_5yrs,                   
x23_job_secure, 
x30_trust_community,x30_trust_community_neighbors, x30_trust_fishers_community,

 # mutate_at(c(24:25), ~replace(., is.na(.), 0)) %>% 
   drop_na(24:34) %>% 
    filter(x53_encourage_regulations != "No regulations")  %>% 
    filter(x46_represent_interests != "No management") %>% 
    filter(x52_ma_benefit_5yrs != "No management")
```


Update on *Agreement* From 9/9/2021: 
In analysis with Dr. Quintana, after looking at variable independence and reframing of what Agreement includes, we are removing the following three questions from the Index: 
- Question 10 (x10_mpa_important) due to wording that doesn't focus on the NTZ
- Question 47 (x47_represent_contributions) due to its near exact math to question 46. This would give these two similar questions as much weight as the other agreement components, which we don't want. 
- Question 62 (x62_reserve_compliance) because this question outright asks if fishers follow the rules. This does not have to do with their Agreement

 After these edits, we have a total of 3464 observations, still only 1 from Brazil, due to question 64. 

Now  columns [24:34] within `hhs_complete_filtered` are all of the Engagement and Agreemen questions. 



- *Dropping NAs*: We drop NAs for all* Engagement and Agreement Questions. 
*We do not drop NAs for the open-ended opinion questions, or 61e, mentioned above. 

- *For Q 46-47* we've excluded NAs since they mostly represent "non-fisher households" The difference in n goes from 5640 to ~3300. We want to see how *fishers* comply though. So the smaller N will show us that. 

Let's just make a quick table with the *counts* of all the survey responses that we have for analysis. 

```{r}
hhs_filtered_count <- hhs_complete_filtered %>% 
  count(ma_name) %>% 
  arrange(-n) %>% 
  #mutate(level1_name = fct_reorder(level1_name, n, sum)) %>% 
  adorn_totals("row") %>% 
  rename("Managed Access Area" = ma_name) %>% 
  rename("Number of surveys with all 'Agreement' and 'Engagement' questions answered" = n)
count_table <- knitr::kable(hhs_filtered_count, format = "html", caption = "Engagement and Agreement Summary") %>% 
  #column_spec(1, italic = TRUE) %>% 
  row_spec(dim(hhs_filtered_count)[1], bold = TRUE) %>%
  kable_styling(c("condensed", "responsive", "bordered"), full_width = F, position = "right") %>% 
  collapse_rows(columns = 1, valign = "middle")
count_table
```


Counts by Reserve is great, but Larissa would like the same table by *Country*

```{r}
hhs_count_by_country <- hhs_complete_filtered %>% 
  count(country) %>% 
  arrange(-n) %>% 
  #mutate(level1_name = fct_reorder(level1_name, n, sum)) %>% 
  adorn_totals("row") %>% 
  rename("Country" = country) %>% 
  rename("Number of surveys with all 'Agreement' and 'Engagement' questions answered" = n)
summary_2 <- hhs_complete_filtered %>% 
     count(country, level1_name, level2_name, ma_name) %>% 
     #arrange(-n) %>% 
     mutate(level1_name = fct_reorder(country, n, sum)) %>% 
     adorn_totals("row")
country_count_table <- knitr::kable(hhs_count_by_country, format = "html", caption = "Engagement and Agreement Country Summary") %>% 
  #column_spec(1, italic = TRUE) %>% 
  row_spec(dim(hhs_count_by_country)[1], bold = TRUE) %>%
  kable_styling(c("condensed", "responsive", "bordered"), full_width = F, position = "right") %>% 
  collapse_rows(columns = 1, valign = "middle")
country_count_table
```



#### Coding numeric values onto survey Answers


Let me list out which A and E questions have binary responses, if the majority of these have "neither agree nor disagree," then I'll move from -1 to 1, with a neutral option.


###### Agreement 

I'll start converting the straightforward questions to 1s and 0s. 
**Because there was so much much dang coding in the global_filtered, I'll make a new dataframe for the numbered version. 
We'll call it **hhs_filtered_numeric**


###### Engagement


Quantification list:

- 44: Yes/No 1/-1 (We recoded not sure to 0, see Methods)
- 45: Yes/No 1/-1 (We recoded 'Not sure to 0, see Methods)
- 48: Yes/No/  Not Sure 1/0/-1 

- 53: Very Often - Never 
[As a back up, this would be flagged for this being its own index of engagement]


- 61 (f): Likert Scale (Strongly) Disagree-Agree (1-5) 
- 61 (h): Likert Scale (Strongly) Agree-Disagree

###### Agreement

- 10: Yes/No/Neutral 1,0,-1
- 43: Yes/No: 1, 0, -1 
- 46: Agree/Neither/Disagree: 1, 0. -1
- 47: Agree/Neither-No Management - na/Disagree: 1, 0. -1
- 52: Yes/Unsure-No management-na/No: 1, 0,-1
- 61(a): Likert Scale (Strongly) Agree-Disagree 0-5
- 61(e): Likert Scale (Strongly) Agree-Disagree 0-5 [GET RID OF]
- 62: Belief that fish catch will... Go up, Go down, remain the same, unsure. 1, 0, -1
- 64: How wrong is fishing in the reserve (Not bad at all, Very bad): 1-5


The chunk below uses `mutate()` and `recode` to complete the numeration above. 
```{r}
hhs_filtered_numeric <- hhs_complete_filtered %>% 
 mutate(x44_meeting_attendance = recode_factor(x44_meeting_attendance, "Yes" = "1", "No"  = "-1", "Not sure" = "0")) %>% 
  mutate(x45_leadership_position = recode_factor(x45_leadership_position, "Yes" = 1, "No"  = -1, "Not sure" = 0, "0" = 0)) %>% 
  mutate(x48_enforcement_participation = recode_factor(x48_enforcement_participation, "Yes" = 1, "No"  = -1, "Not sure" = 0, "0" = 0))  %>% 
   mutate(x53_encourage_regulations = recode_factor(x53_encourage_regulations,    "Never" = -2, "Rarely" = -1, "Sometimes" = 0,   
"Often" = 1, "Very often" = 2)) %>%
## 61 e and h are already coded for likert scale 
  
  
## Agreement recoding below:

  filter_at(vars(x61a_current_regulations, x61f_rights_distribution_fair, x61g_fishing_change_behavior, x64_wrong_fishing_reserve, ), all_vars((.) != 0))
```

Notes: 
- For the Likert scale questions that Rare coded from 0-5, I removed the 0s, since they were equivalent to NAs. 


All "No management" or "No regulations" ar gone. and all 0s have been removed from questions that rare coded from 0-5. Only 1 question made a significant change, `x61f_rights_distribution_fair`


Now, I **believe** it's time to scale the data! 


###### Scaling

```{r}
hhs_scaled <- 
  hhs_filtered_numeric %>% 
  mutate_at(vars(24:27,30, 31, 34 ), ~as.numeric(as.character(.))) %>% 
  
  mutate(x44_scaled = as.numeric((x44_meeting_attendance - mean(x44_meeting_attendance))/sd(x44_meeting_attendance))) %>% 
  
  mutate(x45_scaled = (x45_leadership_position - mean(x45_leadership_position))/sd(x45_leadership_position)) %>% 
  
  mutate(x48_scaled = (x48_enforcement_participation - mean(x48_enforcement_participation))/sd(x48_enforcement_participation)) %>% 
  
  mutate(x53_scaled = (x53_encourage_regulations - mean(x53_encourage_regulations))/sd(x53_encourage_regulations)) %>% 
  
  mutate(x61g_scaled = (x61g_fishing_change_behavior - mean(x61g_fishing_change_behavior))/sd(x61g_fishing_change_behavior)) %>% 
  ##Switch from Engagement to Agreement
 # mutate(x10_scaled = (x10_mpa_important - mean(x10_mpa_important))/ sd(x10_mpa_important)) %>% 
  ## We removed question 10 from the indez
  mutate(x43_scaled = (x43_ma_benefits - mean(x43_ma_benefits))/sd(x43_ma_benefits)) %>% 
  mutate(x46_scaled = (x46_represent_interests - mean(x46_represent_interests))/sd(x46_represent_interests)) %>% 
#  mutate(x47_scaled = (x47_represent_contributions - mean(x47_represent_contributions))/sd(x47_represent_contributions)) %>% 
  # 47 was also removed from the index
  mutate(x52_scaled = (x52_ma_benefit_5yrs - mean(x52_ma_benefit_5yrs))/sd(x52_ma_benefit_5yrs)) %>% 
  mutate(x61a_scaled = (x61a_current_regulations - mean(x61a_current_regulations))/sd(x61a_current_regulations)) %>% 
   mutate(x61f_scaled = (x61f_rights_distribution_fair - mean(x61f_rights_distribution_fair))/sd(x61f_rights_distribution_fair)) %>% 
#  mutate(x62_scaled = (x62_reserve_compliance - mean(x62_reserve_compliance))/sd(x62_reserve_compliance)) %>% 
  ## Question 62 was the third and final question removed. 
  mutate(x64_scaled = (x64_wrong_fishing_reserve - mean(x64_wrong_fishing_reserve))/sd(x64_wrong_fishing_reserve)) 
  
  
  
```

I've double-checked the statistics on each of the above variables! Each new column has a mean of nearly 0 (3x10^-16, etc.)

Since we changed `recode()` to `recode_factor()`, these stats functions would not run. By changing the values to as.numeric, all is well. 

##### Graphing Indices

Erin will tackle the PCA/logistic version thereof, I'm going to  graph our data, using different index measures. 

*Let's start with  `mean()` and `sum()`* 

Along with scaling the data onto a Z-Axis, I'm going to simply sum across the agreement and engagement columns too, to see what we get!
- `eng_mean` is the mean index score of *engagement,* with 1 score for each fisher respondent
- `agree_mean` is the mean score of *agreement* for each fisher respondent 
- I add two more variables:  "raw_eng_sum" and "raw_agree_sum." Without scaling, I've summed agreement and engagement across rows, for exploratory visualization
```{r}
scaled_sum <- hhs_scaled %>% 
 rowwise() %>% 
  mutate(eng_sum = sum(x44_scaled,x45_scaled, x48_scaled, x53_scaled,  x61g_scaled))  %>% 
  mutate(agree_sum = sum (x43_scaled + x46_scaled + x52_scaled + x61a_scaled + x61f_scaled + x64_scaled))  %>% 
  mutate(eng_mean = mean(c(x44_scaled, x45_scaled, x48_scaled, x48_scaled,  x53_scaled,  x61g_scaled))) %>% 
  mutate(agree_mean = mean(c(x43_scaled, x46_scaled, x52_scaled,  x61a_scaled,  x61f_scaled + x64_scaled))) %>% 
    ## Below I add two more variables:  "raw_eng_sum" and "raw_agree_sum." Without scaling, I've summed agreement and engagement across rows, for exploratory visualization
  mutate(raw_eng_sum = sum(c(x44_meeting_attendance, x45_leadership_position, x48_enforcement_participation, x53_encourage_regulations, x61g_fishing_change_behavior))) %>% 
  mutate(raw_agree_sum = sum(c(x43_ma_benefits, x46_represent_interests, x52_ma_benefit_5yrs, x61a_current_regulations, x61f_rights_distribution_fair, x64_wrong_fishing_reserve)))
```


These sum variables are exploratory, with the *mean* score for each observation is the *index* that we will use. 




Here's a Table of Index scores

```{r}
index_table_df <- scaled_sum %>% 
  select(country, eng_mean, agree_mean) %>% 
  rename("Relative Engagement Score" = eng_mean) %>% 
  rename("Relative Agreement Score" = agree_mean)
index_table_k <- knitr::kable(index_table_df, format = "html", caption = "Engagement and Agreement Index Scores") %>% 
  row_spec(dim(index_table_df)[1], bold = TRUE) %>%
  kable_styling(c("condensed", "responsive", "bordered"), full_width = F, position = "right")
## collapse_rows(columns = 3, valign = "middle")
index_table_k
```




With that, we'll make a preliminary graph: 



```{r}
 ggplot(data = scaled_sum,
                      aes(x = eng_mean, y = agree_mean)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = country), size = 0.7, alpha = 0.7) +
labs( x = "Engagement (Scaled across 5 Questions)",
      y = "Agreement (Scaled across 6 Questions)",
      title = "Indices of Engagement and Agreement in Co-Managed Fisheries",
      color = "Country") +
  theme_bw()
  
phil_scaled_graphable <- scaled_sum %>% 
  filter(country == "PHL")
 ggplot(data = phil_scaled_graphable,
                      aes(x = eng_mean, y = agree_mean)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = level2_name), size = 0.7, alpha = 0.7,
             show.legend = TRUE) +
labs( x = "Engagement (Scaled across 5 Questions)",
      y = "Agreement (Scaled across 6 Questions)",
      title = "Indices of Engagement and Agreement in The Phillipines", 
      color = "Region") +
  scale_color_viridis(discrete = TRUE, option = "D") +
  theme_bw()
## ggplot(data = scaled_sum,
##       aes(x = eng_sum, y = agree_sum, color = country)) +
## geom_point(size = 0.7, alpha = 0.7) +
##  theme_bw()
  
## ggplot(data = scaled_sum,
##        aes(x = raw_eng_sum, y = raw_agree_sum, color = country)) +
##   geom_point(size = 0.7, alpha = 0.7) +
##  theme_bw()
```


Action Items: 



- Sensitivity Analysis of Brazil

```{r}
brazil_sensitivity_test <- hhs_all_complete %>% 
  filter(country == "BRA") %>% 
  data.frame() %>% 
  clean_names() %>% 
 select(c(1:2, 6:18, 21:28, x44_meeting_attendance, x45_leadership_position,
x48_enforcement_participation,  x53_encourage_regulations,
 x61g_fishing_change_behavior,
           x43_ma_benefits, x46_represent_interests, x52_ma_benefit_5yrs, x53_encourage_regulations, x61a_current_regulations, x61f_rights_distribution_fair, x64_wrong_fishing_reserve)) %>% 
mutate_at(c(24:25), ~replace(., is.na(.), 0)) %>% 
   drop_na(24:34) %>% 
           #29, 30, 32:38)  
    filter(x53_encourage_regulations != "No regulations")  %>% 
    filter(x46_represent_interests != "No management") %>% 
    filter(x52_ma_benefit_5yrs != "No management")
 
```


- There are 1592 observations from Brazil
- When we filter out NAs for engagement questions, there are 1018
- When we filter NAs for question 10 and 43, we have 1008 (no real difference)
- Filtering 46, 47, 52, 43, 61a, 61f and we drop to 811 (still not bad)
- but there is only ONE! observation from brazil that answered questions 62 and 64 (I wish we'd asked Courtney about this)

Can we (responsibly) mark these folks as neutral? 
*Means*
62: 0.52 (3/4 of folks say they comply on -1/1 scale)
64: 3.9/5 (Most fishers list fishing in the reserve as 'bad' or 'very bad')



- Is it Okay to just model z-scores? 
We want to see actual levels of compliance, but this is the first analysis of its type. We do not have objective "standards" where a fisher's response would change from reluctant to committed.



We'll run two different LN/Logit Models: one for agreement, one for engagement


- Linear regression will give us coefficients for categorical and ordinal questions, but I'll clean the bundles of questions that we want to analyze.

##### Statistical Summaries of Agreement and Engagement

Making some tables and graphs for Claudia + Rare: 


```{r}
hhs_scaled_character <- hhs_scaled %>% 
  as.character(c(24:34))
  
engage_scaled_sum <- hhs_scaled %>%
  select(24:28) 
  
st(engage_scaled_sum)
agree_scaled_sum <- hhs_scaled %>% 
  select(29:34)
st(agree_scaled_sum)
```

Great! 

First, `hhs_scaled` is the df that will be used for all analysis. 

I've run `unique()` for all the E & A questions, ensuring that we only have responses that are measurable. 

Following this with a check of the "no management" answers, and how they were coded. 


With the statistics, we see the new mean, sd, etc. for all the agreement and engagement question. 



##### Playing around with the Logit Model

**Fully exploratory** 
Do not sue the following as results
```{r}
  eng_regression_1 <- lm(data = scaled_sum,
                            eng_mean ~ x50_ma_punishment + 
                              x40_reserve_boundaries_aware)
summary(eng_regression_1)
### Let's do one with 3 ecological outcomes: 19, 22, 23
eng_regression_2 <-  lm(data = scaled_sum,
                            eng_mean ~ x19_current_fish_catch + x22_catch_5yrs + x23_job_secure)
summary(eng_regression_2)
## Here out outcome is a Z-score. with ordinal inputs, should we switch to 1-5? 
```


Let me see if there are some that could seem 'insightful' for a Rare audience to know -Like knowledge of rules! [Questions 38-40]

Those questions are
- Is fishing allowed in the reserve area? (Does fisher X know the rule?)
- Would you agree with the statement that most fishers in your community are aware of the boundaries of the fisheries management/managed access area? (Do msot fishers know the rules)
- Out of ten fishers in your community, how many would you guess know where the reserve boundary is?


```{r}
eng_regression_3 <-  lm(data = scaled_sum,
                            eng_mean ~ x38_reserve_fishing_allowed + x39_ma_boundaries_aware + x40_reserve_boundaries_aware)
summary(eng_regression_3)
```

I'll come back to the ln/multinom, etc. 

First, let's look at a cluster analysis! 

Within Engagement and Agreement- We want to see if there are common combinations of answers like "4, 5, 5" for a likert, or something like that. 



Now, Clustering 

I'm going to explore how many clusters we can see, and try and use a distance-based clustering method first. If possible we want to see common combinations of answers. 

*I.e Within 5 questions, if there ae 250 fishers hat say "Yes," "Slightly agree," and "No," we can learn from that. 

Using Basically, it's going to run 30 different ways of evaluating how many clusters it *thinks* exist, then tell you the breakdown of what they decide (e.g. "8 algorithms think that there should be 4 clusters").

`NbClust::NbClust()`


```{r}
# cluster_number_est <- NbClust(scaled_sum[24:28], min.nc = 2, max.nc = 8, method = "kmeans")
```


So R has suggested that there are *4* meaningful clusters. 

NOTE: We'll have to walk through the weights of 1-5 and -1/1 to having more meaningful analysis within clusters. this is BECAUSE we're not seeing even steps between each 'level up.' 

For now, I run the clusters, and we can go back. 


Looking at 4 clusters:

```{r}
### First I'll just select the engagement variables 
engagement_only <- scaled_sum %>% 
  select(24:28)
engagement_km <- kmeans(engagement_only, 4) ## The 4 means the amount of clusters we're looking at
engagement_km
```

OK! That's a whole lot of information. 

I'll look at a couple key factors

- size
- cluster (which cluster each observation is in)


```{r}
engagement_km$size
engagement_km$cluster
##Making a "binding" df where the cluster of each obsevation is attached to it 
engagement_cl <- data.frame(scaled_sum, cluster_no = factor(engagement_km$cluster))
```

Size of clusters: [1]  465  595 1229  729


Now that these clusters are attached to each observation, let's visualize it 

```{r}
ggplot(engagement_cl) +
  geom_point(aes(x = eng_mean, y = agree_mean, color = cluster_no))
```
This is great, let's map them over country and reserve as well (engagement clsuters.) 


```{r}
ggplot(engagement_cl) +
  geom_point(aes(x = country, y = eng_mean, color = cluster_no))
```
*This is useful to see that there is a diversity of clusters within each country. In other words, we can be assured that the clusters exist beyond just the different countries.* 


Now I'll do K-means clustering again, but include agreement AND engagement questions. 


```{r}
agree_engage_only <- scaled_sum %>% 
  select(24:33)
cluster_number_est_2 <- NbClust(agree_engage_only[1:10], min.nc = 2, max.nc = 8, method = "kmeans")
cluster_number_est_2

 agreement_engagement_km <- kmeans(agree_engage_only, 3) 
 
 ## The 4 means the amount of clusters we're looking at
agreement_engagement_km
```









###### Bar Graphs for each A & E Question

**Engagement** 


1. Question 44

```{r}
x44_counts <- scaled_sum %>% 
 count(x44_meeting_attendance)
ggplot(data = x44_counts,
       aes(x = x44_meeting_attendance, y = n)) +
 geom_bar( stat="identity", fill="goldenrod") +
  theme_bw()
```
*Question 44:  Mean = 0.138, but nearly all respondents said Yes or No. Around 1200 responses did not attend meetings, will around 1600 do attend.*

**Question 45**

```{r}
x45_counts <- scaled_sum %>% 
 count(x45_leadership_position)
ggplot(data = x45_counts,
       aes(x = x45_leadership_position, y = n)) +
 geom_bar( stat="identity", fill="red3") +
  theme_bw()
```
*Question 45: Mean = -0.551. This mean shows that 3/4 of fishers responded "No" Few fisher households included someone with a leadership position within the fishery.*


**Question 48**

```{r}
x48_counts <- scaled_sum %>% 
 count(x48_enforcement_participation)
ggplot(data = x48_counts,
       aes(x = x48_enforcement_participation, y = n)) +
 geom_bar( stat="identity", fill="chartreuse1") +
  theme_bw()
```
*Question 48: Mean = -0.492. Nearly 3 out of 4 fishers do not participate in enforcement.*


A quick pause from graphs! 

Let's see the combination counts for question 45 and 48

```{r}
counts_45_48 <- scaled_sum %>% 
  count(x45_leadership_position, x48_enforcement_participation)
```
- Leaders who don't enforce: 192
- Enforcement volunteers without leadership roles: 250
- Households who do both: 283
-Households who no neither: 1770


```{r}
x53_counts <- scaled_sum %>% 
 count(x53_encourage_regulations)
ggplot(data = x53_counts,
       aes(x = x53_encourage_regulations, y = n)) +
 geom_bar( stat="identity", fill="lightblue") +
  theme_bw()
```
*Question 53: Mean = -0.071. This is just below the "neutral" survey option. We see a very similar totals in the "strongly agree" and "strongly disagree." Our mean skews negative because around 100 more fishers wrote "disagree" relative to "agree."*    




```{r}
x61g_counts <- scaled_sum %>% 
 count(x61g_fishing_change_behavior)
ggplot(data = x61g_counts,
       aes(x = x61g_fishing_change_behavior, y = n)) +
 geom_bar( stat="identity", fill="seagreen2") +
  theme_bw()
```
*Question 61(g) mean = 3.955. This is the first mean that really skews high. With a mode of 4, most respondents were at least "willing" to change their fishing behavior for the reserve structure.*

Here's a check for normal distrbution: 
It looks pretty normal, even with the high amount of "4" responses
```{r}
qqnorm(scaled_sum$x61g_fishing_change_behavior, pch = 1, frame = FALSE)
qqline(scaled_sum$x61g_fishing_change_behavior, col = "steelblue", lwd = 2)
```



*Moving onto Agreement* 

```{r}
x10_counts <- scaled_sum %>% 
 count(x10_mpa_important)
ggplot(data = x10_counts,
       aes(x = x10_mpa_important, y = n)) +
 geom_bar( stat="identity", fill="pink3") +
  theme_bw()
```
*Question 10: Mean = 0.958  Nearly everyone finds "protection" and management to be important for their fishing grounds.*



```{r}
x43_counts <- scaled_sum %>% 
 count(x43_ma_benefits)
ggplot(data = x43_counts,
       aes(x = x43_ma_benefits, y = n)) +
 geom_bar( stat="identity", fill="slateblue2") +
  theme_bw()
```
*43:  Mean  = 0.556. Nearly no one answered with the negative response.*





```{r}
x46_counts <- scaled_sum %>% 
 count(x46_represent_interests)
ggplot(data = x46_counts,
       aes(x = x46_represent_interests, y = n)) +
 geom_bar( stat="identity", fill="mediumorchid2") +
  theme_bw()
```
 *Question 46: Mean = 0.667. Huge skew towards the positive response. 
 
 
```{r}
x47_counts <- scaled_sum %>% 
 count(x47_represent_contributions)
ggplot(data = x47_counts,
       aes(x = x47_represent_contributions, y = n)) +
 geom_bar( stat="identity", fill="olivedrab2") +
  theme_bw()
```
*Question 47: Mean = 0.638. Well over 80% of respondents said "Yes" to representing contributions. 


Checking independence between questions 47 and 47
```{r}
counts_46_47 <- scaled_sum %>% 
  count(x46_represent_interests, x47_represent_contributions)
```

We see that these variables are NOT independent from one another


```{r}
x52_counts <- scaled_sum %>% 
 count(x52_ma_benefit_5yrs)
ggplot(data = x52_counts,
       aes(x = x52_ma_benefit_5yrs  , y = n)) +
 geom_bar( stat="identity", fill="olivedrab3") +
  theme_bw()
```
*Question 52: Mean = 0.506. For the first time, we see a lot of "unsure" answers. This likely has to do with uncertainty in projecting 5 years in the future. 

```{r}
x61a_counts <- scaled_sum %>% 
 count(x61a_current_regulations)
ggplot(data = x61a_counts,
       aes(x = x61a_current_regulations, y = n)) +
 geom_bar( stat="identity", fill="springgreen3") +
  theme_bw()
```
*Question 61(a): Mean = 3.93, clear positive skew, and the mean seems to represent the mode and median*




```{r}
x61f_counts <- scaled_sum %>% 
 count(x61f_rights_distribution_fair)
ggplot(data = x61f_counts,
       aes(x =x61f_rights_distribution_fair, y = n)) +
 geom_bar( stat="identity", fill="skyblue") +
  theme_bw()
```
*61(f): Mean = 3.805. More neutral responses that strongly agree, but very few disagreeing fishers.* 



```{r}
x62_counts <- scaled_sum %>% 
 count(x62_reserve_compliance)
ggplot(data = x62_counts,
       aes(x =x62_reserve_compliance, y = n)) +
 geom_bar( stat="identity", fill="indianred4") +
  theme_bw()
```
Question 62: Mean = 0.525



```{r}
x64_counts <- scaled_sum %>% 
 count(x64_wrong_fishing_reserve)
ggplot(data = x64_counts,
       aes(x =x64_wrong_fishing_reserve, y = n)) +
 geom_bar( stat="identity", fill="chocolate4") +
  theme_bw()
```
*Question 64: Mean = 3.957. Another mean between 3 and 4, with very small numbers of below-neutral responses*
