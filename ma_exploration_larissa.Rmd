##### Reading in Data


```{r}
scaled_sum <- read.csv("scaled_sum.csv")
hhs_all_complete <- read_csv("hhs_all_complete.csv")
scaled_km_df <- read_csv("scaled_km_df.csv")
```


##### Ridgeline plot for MAs

```{r}
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = price, y = cut, fill = cut)) +
  geom_density_ridges() +
  theme_ridges() + 
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

df with MAs and question 19
```{r}
x19_by_ma <- scaled_km_df %>% 
  select(x19_current_fish_catch, cluster_no, ma_name, country) %>% 
  group_by(ma_name) %>% 
  count(x19_current_fish_catch) %>% 
  drop_na()
```

Hey Larissa, I was thinking a ridgeline plot..it's not going how I planned. I'll leave this to your creative brain and get back to organizing Figures. This **should** be kind of fun, let me know if you get frustrated. 
Dyl.
